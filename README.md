# benford_analysis
<<<<<<< HEAD
Forensic and data analytics toolset for testing conformity of data with Benford's law. The toolset has multiple capabilites:

* Synthetic Benford set generation including bruteforce geometric series techniques allowing for varying degrees of conformity. 
* Traditional automated Benford test, including the first, second and first-second digit tests. Each test includes plots of the data, either histograms or discrete heatmaps, and various test statistics assessing conformity. 
* Finite range Benford's law including a generalised finite range implementation using synthetic Benford sets. 
* Other general statistics and miscellaneous tools. 

Each program has its own usage when run without any commandline variables. Any C programs have the compliation instructions commented towards the bottom of the program. The project was developed on Ubuntu 18.04 but should work accross other operating systems.
